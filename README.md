# OGZRealm

Welcome to **OGZRealm** — a cozy corner of the internet where caffeine meets code and dreams turn into pixels. 🎮

I'm **Oğuz**, an indie game dev from **Turkey** who just hit "New Game" on his Unity journey. My ultimate goal? Become a full-time game developer by **2028**

## 🚀 Current Mission

🎯 Build small but meaningful games  
🧠 Learn Unity step by step — from Game Loops to UI Toolkit  
🎥 Document everything on YouTube [@OGZRealm](https://youtube.com/@ogzrealm)  
🌍 Connect with global devs, share the journey, inspire others  

## 🛠 What You'll Find Here

- Unity C# Projects (Beginner to Intermediate)
- Minimalist Mobile Game Concepts
- Assets, Code Snippets, Prototypes
- Devlogs & Progress Tracking
- Some chaos, a lot of coffee, and null reference exceptions ☠️
